# Web Vulnerability Scanner (Educational Project)

A modular Python-based web vulnerability scanner developed step-by-step with versioned milestones.

This project is built for educational purposes to understand:

- Web security testing concepts
- Modular software architecture
- Injection surface modeling
- Version control discipline using Git
